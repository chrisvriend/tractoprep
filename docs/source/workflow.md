# Typical Workflow

1. **Organize data** as BIDS and populate `PhaseEncodingDirection` and `TotalReadoutTime` in the JSON sidecar for the dwi + `IntendedFor` in fieldmaps (if available)
2. **Pull the container** — see {doc}`installation`.
3. **Generate a spec.json** with `helpers/create_spec_template.sh` and
   fill in subject, session (if applicable), and all paths — see {doc}`spec-json`.
4. **Run `dwi-preproc`** for each subject/session. Loop this per
   subject on a cluster using the (SLURM) launcher scripts (see below), or
   script your own loop calling Docker/Podman/Apptainer per subject.
5. **Inspect QC outputs** (`dwi-qc`) before proceeding — check for remaining        artefacts and registration quality 
6. **Run `dwi-tracto`** on subjects that pass QC.
7. **Run `dwi-qc`** (again) to update qc html pages with tracto-specific QC.
8. **Run `dwi-send`** to prepare the completed derivatives for upload (for the ENIGMA OCD project)
9. Use **`dwi-params`** at any stage to pull out acquisition/processing
   parameters for logging or a shared summary spreadsheet.

## Pipeline launcher

Below are engine specific scripts to launch the entire workflow for your entire sample
(in the bids directory) using a SLURM array or without.
At the top of the script you can adjust how many participants are processed in parallel.
Based on testing we provide best guess settings under the **Per-stage resource settings**
section — adjust where necessary.

```{note}
Although it is recommended to first run **dwi-qc** before continuing to **dwi-tracto**,
in these pipeline launchers using SLURM arrays, preprocessing and tractography steps are run back to back unless you set the `--preproc-only` flag
